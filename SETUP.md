### Setup Instructions for the mapit.space submission

## Setup
URGENT: 
1. The way we have this set up right now utilizes clientID/clientSecrets that must be set up manually to work on your local web server. Please do not push proxy/PHP/proxy.config to the final submissions repository with the clientID/clientSecrets fields filled in.
2. We configured the Geometry Service in our web application to use the url: https://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/ for the purpose of this project. This server has limited use and should be swapped out with a dedicated server url. . This change can be made in goelectric.html at line 502 following "new GeometryService". If the sample server is down, our Savings Calculator will not work and the server will return a 503 error.


Instructions
1. Unzip the submission folder.
2. Copy contents to the web server folder (will be denoted in subsequent steps as <www folder>).
3. Navigate to <www folder>/proxy/PHP/
4. Open "proxy.config" with your favourite text editor (ex. notepad++)
5. Go to line 5, featuring "allowedReferers"
6. Replace "localhost:41471" with your local web server name
7. Save proxy.config
8. Open your favourite web browser and enter the url of your local web server (ex. localhost:41471)
9. Navigate from the application homepage (index.html) to "Explore" in the top right hand corner of the screen
10. Observe the web map application (goelectric.html)
