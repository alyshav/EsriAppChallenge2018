User wants to calculate savings per year and see comparison to average gas vehicle:
-- user input:
1) User enters their home
2) user enters work/destination
-- functions called:
3) Calculate Route using RouteTask https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-tasks-RouteTask.html
4) Use RouteResult object (can convert to JSON) https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-tasks-support-RouteResult.html
-- output:
5) savings over time value & a nice line on the map. (we could also highlight charging stations within x mins of their route? can use https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/analyze/create-buffers.htm for this and intersect)


User wants to figure out where charging stations are close to a point they have specified:
-- user input:
1) User enters location marker
2) User specifies time they are willing to spend driving to the charging station
-- functions called:
3) "Find Nearest" https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/analyze/find-nearest.htm
--output:
4) filtered view or list side panel of all charging stations in order of proximity (could also list numbers beside them like x is 15 mins away, y is 16 mins away, etc)


User wants to see how far they can drive on one charge:
-- user input:
1) User enters location marker
x) (do we have the user enter a model they care about? or should we use a single model for this work to keep it simpler and add later if time?)
-- functions called:
2) "Create Drive Time Areas" https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/analyze/create-drive-time-areas.htm
NOTE: we might actually need web app builder for this. will do more research
-- output:
3) Feature layer
